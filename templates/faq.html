        How accurate is the health rating?

      </button>
      <div class="faq-a">The rating follows the official Australian Health Star Rating (HSR) methodology — the same system used on packaged food in Australia and New Zealand. The AI reads every value on your label and applies the exact formula. Accuracy depends on the label being clearly readable in the photo.</div>

        What is the Australian Health Star Rating (HSR)?
        <span class="arrow">▼</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-a">HSR is a front-of-pack labelling system developed by the Australian and New Zealand governments. It rates packaged food from ½ star (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy), based on energy, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, protein, fibre, and fruit/vegetable/nut content per 100g or 100ml.</div>

      <div class="faq-a">No. Your image is processed in memory and discarded after analysis. We do not store, log, or share any photos you upload or capture.</div>

      <div class="faq-a">Make sure the nutrition table is fully visible, well-lit, and in focus. Avoid glare or reflections. Capture only the back panel of the product where the nutrition facts are printed. If it still fails, try uploading a clearer photo.</div>
