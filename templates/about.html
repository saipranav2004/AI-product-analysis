    Baagundhaaa? (బాగుందా?) means <em>"Is it good?"</em> in Telugu.<br>
    Built because food labels are confusing — and most people just don't read them.

    <div class="detail-label">Why we built this</div>
    <div class="detail-value" style="line-height:1.8;">
      India has one of the world's fastest-growing packaged food markets — yet most consumers don't know what's really in their food.
      Labels are tiny, technical, and deliberately confusing. We wanted to change that with a single scan.
      <br><br>
      Baagundhaaa? started as a personal project and became something we use every grocery run.
      From HSR ratings to FSSAI checks to same-brand alternatives — every feature exists because a real user needed it.
      We hope it helps you too.
